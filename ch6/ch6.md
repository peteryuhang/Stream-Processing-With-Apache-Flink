## Time-Based and Window Operators

### Configuring Time Characteristics

- In the DataStream API, you can use the time characteristic to tell Flink how to define time when you are creating windows
- The time characteristic is a property of the `StreamExecutionEnvironment` and it takes the following values:
  - **ProcessingTime**
    - Operators determine the current time of the data stream according to the system clock of the machine where they are being executed
    - In general, using processing time for window operations results in nondeterministic results
    - This setting offers very low latency because processing tasks do not have to wait for watermarks to advance the event time
  - **EventTime**
    - Operators determine the current time by using information from the data itself
    - An event-time window triggers when the watermarks declare that all timestamps for a certain time interval have been received
    - Event-time windows compute deterministic results even when events arrive out of order
  - **IngestionTime**
    - It is a hybrid of EventTime and ProcessingTime
    - The ingestion time of an event is the time it entered the stream processor
