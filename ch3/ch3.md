## The Architecture of Apache Flink

### System Architecture

- Common challenges that distributed systems need to address:
  - Allocation and management of compute resources in a cluster
  - Coordination, Durable and highly available data storage
  - Failure recovery
- Flink is well integrated with cluster resource managers, such as Apache Mesos, YARN, and Kubernetes, but can also be configured to run as a standalone cluster
- Flink does not provide durable, distributed storage. Instead, it takes advantage of distributed filesystems like HDFS or object stores such as S3
- For leader election in highly available setups, Flink depends on Apache ZooKeeper
